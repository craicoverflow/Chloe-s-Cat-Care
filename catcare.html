  <h2>Feeding</h2>

  <p style="font-size:130%;"> Of course high-quality, popular brands would be recommended to feed any pet. If you are unsure 
      about which brand of food to use, feel free to ask us or your veterinarian. Cats require different
      foods depending on their age and their activity level and health influence the amount of food
      they should receive. You must wash and refill your cat's water bowl daily. It should always have
      fresh, clean water at all times. Treats should be no more than 5-10 percent of your cat's diet.
      If a cat or kitten isn't feeling well or refusing to eat, some people give them baby food.
      However, if the food contains onion or garlic powder, you could poison your pet. </p>
    <h2>Grooming</h2> 
    <img src=" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41AW6oon-QL.jpg"alt="cat brush">
    <p style="font-size:130%;"> Cats rarely need baths and take pride in cleaning themselves but you
        should brush or comb your cat regularly. Not only does it keep your kitty clean, it reduces
        the amount of shedding. It also reduces hairballs.
     <h2>How to Lift Your Cat</h2>

<p style="font-size:130%;" > Some cats do not appreciate being lifted but if your cat is comfortable with it, this is how you do
    it properly. You place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters. Make
    sure to be gentle. Don't pick a cat up by the by the front legs. Also, just because a mother cat
    lifts her young up by the neck doesn't mean you should lift them up by the scruff of the neck. </p>
    <h2>Housing</h2>

    <p style="font-size:130%;" >Your pet should have a clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest.
        Wash the bedding often. Outdoor cats do not live as long, so please give them a bed inside. </p> 
        <h2>Litter Box</h2>

        <p style="font-size:130%;" > One litter box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving the box.
            Scoop waste out daily. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least
            once a week. </p>
