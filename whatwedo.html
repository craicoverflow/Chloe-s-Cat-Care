      <p style="font-size:150%;"> Our main purpose is for people to find family in felines. We want people to bring unfortunate
          cats into their homes. We give you the necessary information to look after cats and encourage
          you to contact us if you require additional information about a certain topic. You can also
          donate to the cause so we can provide money to the people who are struggling to afford to
          look after their pets properly. We hold fundraisers and welcome any volunteers to take part
          in the events. You can buy cat related items and products needed for feline care in our shop,
          where all proceeds go into funding for veterinary practices.
